# Marsh Critter by qma

It lives in the marshes... ray marshes, if you bear with my pun :)

This is my entry to the 1k intro competition of Assembly Summer 2022:
My first experiment using the Win32 platform and Crinkler.
This was also my first real exploration in the cool world of marching
distance fields. Unfortunately the cool version with reflections, shadows,
and nicer synth was 1200 bytes and I had to let go of the neat tricks to
crunch this in the 1024 bytes.. But it is an entry! And in the hardcore
compo of 1k intros. And it has sort of a concept.. So I'm happy with it..
More ray marching will surely be done later, and entries will keep on
coming.

I hope I remember to make the source codes available after the compo is
shown at Assembly; they will be in some as-of-yet-unnamed repository
under my github account: https://github.com/puavous

I must thank Inigo Quilez for the great tutorials and example codes which
I have been exploring this summer.

Now, August 5th, 2022, 8pm, it is time for a refreshing beverage and
mingling with the crowds, I believe...

Sending my love to everybody on the demoscene. Party on!
